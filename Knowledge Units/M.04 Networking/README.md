# M.4 Networking

Computer and communications networks are the very environment in which
cyber operations are conducted. An understanding of these networks is
essential to any discussion of cyber operations activities.

Specific topics to be covered in this knowledge unit include, but are
not limited to:

*Outcome*: Students will have a thorough understanding of how networks
work at the infrastructure, network and applications layers; how they
transfer data; how network protocols work to enable communication; and
how the lower-level network layers support the upper ones. They will
have a thorough knowledge of the major network protocols that enable
communications and data transfer.
