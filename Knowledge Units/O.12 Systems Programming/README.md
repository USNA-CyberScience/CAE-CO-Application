# O.12 Systems Programming

This knowledge unit ensures that students will be proficient in
programming systems software (i.e., software that interacts with the
system hardware and/or other low-level system components that interact
with the hardware). Systems programming usually uses a low-level
programming language (e.g., C, assembly) that allows efficient use of
core resources. Systems programming is sufficiently different from
applications programming such that programmers tend to specialize in one
or the other.

Specific topics to be covered in this knowledge unit include, but are
not limited to:

| ***Topic*** | ***Assessment*** |
| --- | --- |
| Kernel modules | EC404 (Dr Delozier) |
| Device drivers | EC463 (Controllers and Drivers) Dr Ngo |
| Multi-threading | EC404 (Operating Systems) Dr Delozier |
| Use of alternate processors (e.g., graphics card processors) | EC462 (Dr Rakvic) |

*Outcome*: Students will be able to build and integrate kernel modules,
understand the system call mechanism and how malicious software subverts
system calls. They should demonstrate sufficient knowledge of the
networking stack to be able to construct network filter components. They
will also be able to discuss strengths and weaknesses of alternative
processors and demonstrate familiarity of tool sets for making use of
alternative processors (e.g., GPUs).
