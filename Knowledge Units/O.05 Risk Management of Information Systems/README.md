# O.5 Risk Management of Information Systems

Risk Management of Information Systems is a critical topic area which
forms the basis for applying information system security principles to
an operational environment. Risk Management decisions are the embodiment
of the organization's security culture and values as demonstrated
through the willingness to commit resources to information system
security capabilities.

Given the significant and growing danger of cyber security threats, it
is imperative that all levels of an organization understand their
responsibilities for achieving adequate information security and for
managing information system-related security risks.

Specific topics to be covered in this knowledge unit include, but are
not limited to:

*Outcome*: Students will be able to identify, measure (quantitative and
qualitative), and mitigate key information technology risks.

*Outcome*: Students will also be able to describe each of the tasks
associated with risk framing, assessment, response and monitoring.
