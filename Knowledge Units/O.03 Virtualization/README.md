# O.3 Virtualization (must include hands-on lab exercises)

Virtualization technology has rapidly spread to become a core feature of
enterprise environments, and is also deeply integrated into many server,
client, and mobile platforms. It is also widely used in IT development,
research, and testing environments. Virtualization is also a key
technology in cyber security. As such a deep technical understanding of
the capabilities and limitations of modern approaches to virtualization
is critical to cyber operations.

Specific topics to be covered in this knowledge unit include, but are
not limited to:

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>Topic</th>
			<th>Assessment</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="50%">Type I and Type II architectures</td>
			<td width="50%">DIscussed in SY401 and SY402 - extensive use of VMs for weekly labs. We use Type I (via VMWare ESXI) and discuss the use Type II. Students have extensive experience creating, leveraging, and attacking VMs in both classes.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="50%">Virtualization Principles including efficiency, resource control and equivalence</td>
			<td width="50%">These topics are discussed in classroom lectures and applied in weekly labs in both SY401 and SY402.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="50%">Virtualization techniques for code execution, including trap and emulate, binary translation, paravirtualization, and hardware-supported virtualization (e.g., Intel VMX)</td>
			<td width="50%">CST, SY401</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="50%">Management of memory in virtualized systems, including hardware supported memory management (e.g. EPT/SLAT), memory deduplication, and isolation of VM hypervisor and memory spaces</td>
			<td width="50%">SY303 and SY401</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="50%">Techniques for allocating storage (e.g., hard drives) to Virtual Machines, and the associated capabilities (e.g., snapshots)</td>
			<td width="50%">These techniques are discussed and applied using VMWare in SY401 and 402 labs</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="50%">Techniques for associating hardware (virtual or physical) with virtual machines, including hardware-supported methods (e.g., SR-IOV) and device emulation</td>
			<td width="50%"></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="50%">Techniques for providing advanced virtualization capabilities, such as live-migration and live-failover</td>
			<td width="50%"></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="50%">Internal and External Interfaces provided by virtualized platforms for management, monitoring, and internal communication/synchronization</td>
			<td width="50%"></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="50%">Snapshots, migration, failover</td>
			<td width="50%">SY401/402 supported by a faculty member and in CST</td>
		</tr>

Note: Education focused on simply using VMs or virtualization
platforms/tools (such as vSphere, HyperV, or VirtualBox) for efficiency
purposes (e.g. server consolidation) is not sufficient to address this
KU.

*Outcome*: Students will understand and be able to describe the
technical mechanisms by which virtualization is implemented in a variety
of environments, and their implications for cyber operations.

*Outcome*: Students will be able to enumerate and describe the various
interfaces between the hypervisors, VMs, physical and virtual hardware,
management tools, networking, storage, and external environments.
