# O.10 Embedded Systems

An embedded system is a computer system with a dedicated function within
a larger mechanical or electrical system, often with real-time computing
constraints. It includes a microprocessor, memory, and peripherals
either packaged as an SOC or as separate components within the device.
It is embedded as part of a complete device often including hardware and
mechanical parts. It typically has more robust user interaction than a
microcontroller. The embedded system's function typically changes very
little, if at all, over the lifecycle of an instance of the system.
Examples of embedded systems would include a wireless router or military
weapons systems.

*Outcome*: Students are knowledgeable of the concepts, methods,
techniques, technologies, requirements, and development tools commonly
used in the design and implementation of embedded systems. They will be
able to develop or make a substantial modification to a simple embedded
system and identify the cyber concerns associated with such an embedded
system.
