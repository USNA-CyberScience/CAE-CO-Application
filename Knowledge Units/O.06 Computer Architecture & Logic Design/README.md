# O.6 Computer Architecture (includes Logic Design)

This knowledge unit ensures students understand the components that
comprise a computing system and possess the ability to assess processor
design and organization alternatives as they impact functionality and
performance of a system.

Specific topics to be covered in this knowledge unit include, but are
not limited to:

*Outcome*: Students will be able to define devices of electronic digital
circuits and describe how these components are interconnected. They will
be able to integrate individual components into a more complex digital
system and understand the data path through a CPU.
