# O.9 Secure Software Development

This knowledge unit ensures that students know how to write robust,
secure software. These methods taught in this class should lead to
software that maintains the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability
of the software and data.

Specific topics to be covered in this knowledge unit include, but are
not limited to:

<table>

*Outcome*: Students should be able to demonstrate that they understand
the techniques specifying program behavior, the classes of well-known
defects, and how they manifest themselves in various languages.

*Outcome*: Students will understand how poor coding affects security and
can identify common coding errors. Students will demonstrate that they
are capable of authoring programs that are free from defects and can
document their code with clear and succinct explanations, so other
people can enhance and maintain the developed code.
