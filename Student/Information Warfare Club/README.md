## Information Warfare Community (IWC) Club

The Navy’s Information Warfare Community (IWC) is comprised of
Cryptologic Warfare Officers (CWO), Cyber Warfare Engineers (CWE),
Information Professional Officers (IP), Intelligence Officers, and
Meteorology & Oceanography Officers (METOC). *The IWC is the primary
community in the Navy that plans and executes cyberspace operations,
both defensive and offensive.*

Established in 2019, the IWC Club is the newest and fastest-growing USNA
club with over 400 midshipmen actively participating. It is a club run
by midshipmen in order to better educate and inform them on the
Information Warfare Community. Their mission is to build relationships
between officers and midshipmen while expanding midshipmen
understanding of the IWC and its career opportunities, including roles
in cyber operations, in order to develop connections and ensure
professional development. 

IWC midshipmen officers distribute information emails and briefs to the
members on a weekly basis, many of them related to cyber operations. 

The IWC Club midshipmen officers and members have participated in
various cyber events such as the FireEye Defense Summit, Atlantic
Futures Forum onboard HMS Queen Elizabeth, and other various meetings
with cyber-related companies and senior leaders.
