# Student Involvement in Cyber Operations Research and Related Activities

Students at USNA are involved in a variety of research, competitive, and outreach activities related to cyber operations.

## Student Capstone Projects

-   **Hardening Autonomous Drones for Combat Augmentation**  
    *Niles Moffat, Eric Roque-Jackson, Zach Makkonen*

    The goal of this project is to harden autonomous drones to electronic
    attacks, making them more survivable in a combat environment. Working
    with the Office of Naval Research's Squads with Autonomous Teammates
    Challenge (SWAT-C) our group is testing the Navy team's drones for
    vulnerabilities. Our research has discovered glaring vulnerabilities on
    the drones which renders them combat ineffective. Further research is
    being conducted to patch these vulnerabilities.

-   **Securing Critical Infrastructure: An Open Source Approach**  
    *Sam Teplov, Anthony Dohse, Elijah Kilmer, Matt McCraith*
    
    This project aims to solve the difficult problem of securing critical
    infrastructure in a cost-efficient and effective manner. The final
    version of this software combines various open source tools into a
    powerful security suite that allows individuals to analyze and detect
    potential threats within their operational technology (OT) network.
    
-   **Fork After Withholding: Attacking Bitcoin For Profit**  
    *Noah Engel, Peter Hinsa, Mitchell Pendleton*
    
    The goal of this project is to determine if given a certain amount of
    computing power and resources, if it is feasible to use the FAW (Fork
    After Withholding) attack on bitcoin to obtain a mathematical advantage
    over other bitcoin miners to result in a significant amount of profit.
    
-   **Profiling a Software Developer - The Link Between Personality and the
    Development of Technical Skills**  
    *Reagan Bearden, Mary Elise Brady, Hannah Decker, Morgan Giraud*
    
    The goal of this project is to develop the profile of a cyber operator
    during adolescence to benefit the US Intelligence Community. This study
    looks explicitly at the link between personality and the aptitude for
    software development utilizing resources at the NSA (specifically in the
    CNO) and assessing 3 specific personality tests: Myers Briggs, the Big
    5, and DiSC.
