## Women in Cyber and Computing Club (WICC)

In September 2016, to bridge this gap in the fields of cyber and
computing, a team of female midshipmen and civilian faculty members
formed a group to support and empower females in the cyber domain. This
organization, called Women in Cyber and Computing (WiCC), has been
integral in the development of future cyber warriors. In tandem with the
aims of providing mentorship opportunities, professional development
experiences, and a support group to encourage females in the technical
fields, WiCC has successfully been able to give back through community
outreach.

The Naval Academy is unique in that students do not choose their major
until half way through their second semester of their freshmen year.
WiCC takes advantage of this unique window by exposing female midshipmen
to the aspects of cyber and computing with the goal of increasing the
number of females in Cyber and Computer Science amongst other STEM
related majors. Through sponsoring conference attendance and hosting
powerful female speakers, WiCC exposes young students to cyber and
computing. Additionally, the group has developed a mentoring network for
students to engage with Naval Officers and DOD Civilians working in
technical fields.

WICC has participated in the following conferences and events:

-   Grace Hopper Conference (2016, 2017, 2018, 2019)

-   FireEye Cyber Defense Summit (2018, 2019)

-   CyberWire Women in Cybersecurity Reception (2018,2019)

-   Women in Cybersecurity (WiCyS) Conference (2016, 2017, 2018, 2019)

-   Jean Bartik Computing Symposium (2019, 2020)

-   AvengerCon (2019)

    -   Two WICC midshipmen led a half-day cyber policy simulation at
        this conference

WICC has also conducted multiple cyber outreach events at Annapolis
middle schools and USNA STEM events on the yard since 2016.

As of January 2020, there are over 100 female midshipmen in WiCC being
led by an officer representative from the Cyber Science Department.
