# M.9 Vulnerabilities

Vulnerabilities are not random events, but follow a pattern.
Understanding the pattern of vulnerabilities and attacks can allow one
to better understand protection, risk mitigation, and identify
vulnerabilities in new contexts. Vulnerability analysis and it's
relation to exploit development are core skills for one involved in
cyber operations.

Specific topics to be covered in this knowledge unit include, but are
not limited to:

| ***Topic***                                                  | ***Assessment***
|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Vulnerability taxonomies such as CVE, CWE, OSVDB, and CAPEC  | These vulnerabilities are discussed in SY401 and 402 and applied in the weekly labs. |
| Buffer overflows                                             | Buffer overflow techniques are discussed in SY401 lectures. Students perform buffer overflow attacks in detail in SY308. |
| Privilege escalation attacks                                 | Privilege escalation techniques are demonstrated in labs and classroom demonstrations in SY401/402. This is renforced as a technique based on the Offensive Cyber Operations Framework. |
| Input validation issues                                      | SY308 |
| Password weaknesses                                          | <p>Password cracking techniques are demonstrated in class lectures and lab work for SY401/402<p>SY201: supports (Pswd Stretching, Pswd Cracking)<p>SY301: supports (Pswd Cracking) |
| Trust relationships                                          | Exploiting trust the Social Engineering Toolkit in Kali Linux is demonstrated in SY401 lab and lectures. |
| Race conditions                                              | --- |
| Numeric over/underflows                                      | --- |
| User-space vs. kernel-space vulnerabilities                  | SY204 covers this in the OS Overview and System Programming Concepts lectures |
| Local vs. remote access                                      | Local and remote access techniques and patterns are demonstrated in class and lab demonstrations in SY401/402. |

*Outcome*: Students will possess a thorough understanding of the various
types of vulnerabilities (design and/or implementation weaknesses),
their underlying causes, their identifying characteristics, the ways in
which they are exploited, and potential mitigation strategies. They will
also know how to apply fundamental security design principles during
system design, development and implementation to minimize
vulnerabilities.

*Outcome*: Students will understand how a vulnerability in a given
context may be applied to alternative contexts and to adapt
vulnerabilities so that lessons from them can be applied to alternative
contexts.
