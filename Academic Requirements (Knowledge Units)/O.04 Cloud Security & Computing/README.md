# O.4 Cloud Security/Cloud Computing

Cloud resources are commonly used for a wide variety of use cases,
including the provision of enterprise services, data processing and
analysis, development and testing, and a wide variety of consumer
focused services. As such it is important that the students have a clear
understanding of the variety, complexity, and capabilities of modern
cloud platforms. Cloud computing has implications for cyber operations
not only as a potential target, but also as an extensive resource to
bring relatively cheap computing power to solve problems (e.g. cracking
passwords) which would have been more difficult pre-cloud.

Specific topics to be covered in this knowledge unit include, but are
not limited to:

*Outcome*: Students will understand and be able to describe a variety of
cloud service models and deployment modes, and select appropriate
service models and delivery modes for a variety of potential workloads,
including enumerating the security tradeoffs associated with their
selections.

*Outcome*: Students will be able to develop and deploy a workload in an
appropriate cloud environment, including addressing issues associated
with deployment, configuration, management, scalability, and security.
