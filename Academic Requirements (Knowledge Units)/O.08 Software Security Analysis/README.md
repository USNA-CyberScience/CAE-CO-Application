# O.8 Software Security Analysis

This knowledge unit ensures that students will possess the ability to
analyze software for the presence of weaknesses that may lead to
exploitable vulnerabilities in operational systems.

Specific topics to be covered in this knowledge unit include, but are
not limited to:

<table>

			<td width="50%">Static analysis is the backbone for SY485J - Objdump and Ghidra are used for this.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="50%">Dynamic code analysis techniques</td>
			<td width="50%">Dynamic analysis must be used in half the labs in SY485J. gdb is the the primary tool used.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="50%">Testing methodologies (Black Box/White Box/Fuzz)</td>
			<td width="50%">Fuzzing is a method that is discussed and demoed in class as a way to test software before reversing - testing extreme input/output possibilities to observe behavior of software. SY485J stresses the importance of all kinds of testing of software, not just reverse engineering, to build a complete picture of what the software is doing.</td>

*Outcome*: Students will be able to perform analysis of existing source
code for functional correctness. Through the application of testing
methodologies, students should be able to build test cases that
demonstrate the existence of vulnerabilities. For example, students
could apply industry standard tools that analyze software for security
vulnerabilities.
