#### M.1 Low Level Programming Languages (must include programming assignments to demonstrate that students are capable of the desired outcomes)

Low level programming allows programmers to construct programs that
interact with a system without the layers of abstraction that are
provided by many high level languages. Proficiency in low-level
programming languages is required to perform key roles in the cyber
operations field (e.g., forensics, malware analysis, exploit
development).

*Specific languages required to satisfy this knowledge unit are:*

**Assembly Language programming (for x86, ARM, MIPS or PowerPC)**

*Outcome*: After completing the course content mapped to this knowledge
unit, students will be able to develop low level programs with the
required complexity and sophistication to implement exploits for
discovered vulnerabilities.

**C Language programming\
***Outcome*: Students will be able to write complex programs such as
ones that implement a simple network stack.

**Assembly Language programming\
***Outcome*: Students will be able to write a functional, stand-alone
assembly language program, such as a simple telnet client, with no help
from external libraries.
