# M.6 Discrete Math and Algorithms

In order for cyber operators to make educated choices when provided with
an array of algorithms and approaches to solving a particular problem,
there are essential underlying concepts drawn from discrete mathematics,
algorithms analysis, and finite automaton with which they should be
familiar.

Specific topics to be covered in this knowledge unit include, but are
not limited to:

| ***Topic***                                | ***Assessment***                       |
| -------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Searching and sorting algorithms           | SY301                                  |
| Complexity theory                          | SY301                                  |
| Regular expressions                        | <p>SY205 - Shell/Command Line operations<p>SY402 - use GREP to sort files/logs|
| Computability                              | SY301, SY308                           |
| Mathematical foundations for cryptography  | SY308                                  |
| Entropy                                    | SY308                                  |

*Outcome*: Given an algorithm, a student will be able to determine the
complexity of the algorithm and cases in which the algorithm would/would
not provide a reasonable approach for solving a problem.

*Outcome*: Students will understand how variability affects outcomes,
how to identify anomalous events, and how to identify the meaning of
anomalous events.

*Outcome*: Students will understand how automata are used to describe
computing machines and computation, and the notion that some things are
computable and some are not. They will understand the connection between
automata and computer languages and describe the hierarchy of language
from regular expression to context free.
