# O.1 Programmable Logic (must include hands-on lab exercises)

In digital electronic systems, logic devices provide specific functions,
including device-to-device interfacing, data communication, signal
processing, data display, timing and control operations, and several
other system functions. Logic devices can be fixed, or programmable
using a logic language. The advantage of a programmable logic device
(PLD) is the ability to use a programmable logic language to implement a
design into a PLD and immediately test it in a live circuit.

Specific topics to be covered in this knowledge unit include, but are
not limited to:

| ***Topic***                                                                                               | ***Assessment***              |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Hardware design/programming languages (e.g. VHSIC Hardware Design Language (VHDL), Verilog, OpenCL)       |                               |
| Programmable logic devices (Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC), Fully Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA))  |                               |
                                                                                                             
*Outcome*: Students will be able to specify digital device behavior
using programmable logic language. They will be able to design,
synthesize, simulate, and implement logic on an actual programmable
logic device. For instance, students will be able to perform parallel
computational tasks such as taking multiple cipher cores and running
them in parallel to perform password cracking attacks.
