# O.2 Wireless Security (must include hands-on lab exercises)

Wireless systems are essential to enabling mobile users. However, a
significant impact in security can result from the use of wireless or
the improper configuration of wireless security due to the erratic
nature of the wireless environment. The dynamic and inconsistent
connectivity of wireless requires unique approaches to networking in
everything from user identification and authentication to message
integrity and cipher synchronization.

Specific topics to be covered in this knowledge unit include, but are
not limited to:

*Outcome*: Students will be able to describe the unique security and
operational attributes in the wireless environment and their effects on
network communications. They will be able to identify the unique
security implications of these effects and how to mitigate security
issues associated with them.

*Outcome*: Students will be able to describe and demonstrate the
vulnerabilities with ineffective mechanisms for securing or hiding
802.11 traffic.

*Outcome*: Students will be able to understand, describe, and implement
a secure wireless network that uses modern encryption and enforces the
proper authentication of users.

*Outcome*: Students will be able to compare and contrast mechanisms for
association and authentication with a GSM BSC and a UMTS RNC.
