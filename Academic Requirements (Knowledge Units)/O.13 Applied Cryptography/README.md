# O.13 Applied Cryptography

In cyber operations it is critical to understand the role of keys,
cryptographic algorithms, and protocols as they relate to security
(attacks and defenses) in complex real-life systems.

Specific topics to be covered in this knowledge unit include, but are
not limited to:

*Outcome*: Students will be able to identify the appropriate uses of
symmetric and asymmetric encryption. They will be able to assign some
measure of strength to cryptographic algorithms and the associated keys.

*Outcome*: Students will understand the common pitfalls or shortcomings
associated with the implementation of cryptography, and will understand
the challenges and limitations of current key management systems.

*Outcome*: Given an enterprise architecture scenario consisting of
different components (e.g. servers, clients, databases) with information
that has various temporal and distribution constraints, networks,
multiple sites, and trusted and untrusted clients, students will
describe the appropriate cryptographic tools/algorithms/protocols that
can be applied at various locations throughout that architecture in
order to achieve a variety of goals, and the management
challenges/tradeoffs associated with their choices.
