# O.17 Hardware Reverse Engineering

Hardware Reverse Engineering is the study of hardware hacking and
reverse engineering approaches that are routinely used against
electronic devices and embedded systems. This knowledge unit provides
students with an introduction to the basic procedures necessary to
perform reverse engineering of hardware components to determine their
functionality, inputs, outputs, and stored data.

Specific topics to be covered in this knowledge unit include, but are
not limited to:

| ***Topic***                                     | ***Assessment*** |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Hardware reverse engineering methodology        |                  |
| The use of tools and test measurement equipment |                  |
| Circuit board analysis and modification         |                  |
| Embedded security                               |                  |
| Common hardware attack vectors                  |                  |

*Outcome*: Students will understand basic fundamental procedures such as
probing, measuring, and data collection to identify functionality and to
affect modifications to the hardware functionality.

*Outcome*: Students will understand the proper use of evaluation tools
and common hardware attack vectors.
