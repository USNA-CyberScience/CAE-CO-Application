# O.7 Microcontroller Design (must include hands-on lab exercises)

A microcontroller (or MCU, short for microcontroller unit) is a small,
simple computer on a single integrated circuit containing a processor
core, limited memory, and programmable input/output peripherals and
sensors. Microcontrollers are typically inexpensive and have little or
no interface for human interaction. They are typically programmed for a
fixed function with little or no change over their lifecycle.

Specific topics to be covered in this knowledge unit include, but are
not limited to:

*Outcome*: Students are knowledgeable of the concepts, methods,
techniques, technologies, requirements, and development tools commonly
used in the design and implementation of microcontroller applications.
They will be able to develop or make a substantial modification to a
simple microcontroller-based system and identify the cyber concerns
associated with such a system.
