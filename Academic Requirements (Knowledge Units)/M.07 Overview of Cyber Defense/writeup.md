#### M.7 Overview of Cyber Defense (must include hands-on lab exercises)

Cyber operations encompass both offensive and defensive operations.
Defensive operations are essential in protecting our systems and
associated digital assets. Understanding how defense compliments offense
is essential in a well-rounded cyber operations program.

Specific topics to be covered in this knowledge unit include, but are
not limited to:

  Identification of reconnaissance operations                               []{#_gjdgxs .anchor}These techniques are demonstrated in labs and lectures in SY401 as both passive and active reconnaissance using open source tools such as NMAP.

  Anomaly/intrusion detection                                               These techniques are demonstrated in labs and lectures in SY402 using student built rules in python and using SNORT.

  Anomaly identification                                                    These are demonstrated in SY402 labs using SPLUNK and SNORT using rules and behavior based labs.

  Identification of command and control operations                          These are discussed and demonstrated in SY401 (offensive operations) and SY402 (defensive operations). The development of C&C infrastructure using VMs is also discussed and demonstrated in labs/lectures using Metasploit, Armitage, and ToR.

  Identification of data exfiltration activities                            These are demonstrated in labs and lectures in SY401/402. We discuss COVCOM and use of ToR for hiding traffic as well as use of exploits that take advantage of routine services and ports to exfil traffic from a host or network. See SY401 course material

  Identifying malicious code based on signatures, behavior and artifacts    These are demonstrated in labs and lectures in SY401/402. We discuss the use of VirusTotal for identifying hashes and SHAs as well as how AV leverages cloud based and behavioral characteristics

  Network security techniques and components (e.g., firewalls, IDS, etc.)   These are demonstrated in labs and lectures in SY401/402 using open source tools such as SNORT and packet sniffers
                                                                            
                                                                            Firewalls: SY205, planned CY2020 Fall.

  Cryptography (include PKI cryptography) and its uses in cybersecurity     SY308 discusses this area and this is re-enforces in SY401and 402.

  Malicious activity detection                                              These are discussed and demonstrated in labs and lectures in SY401/402 using open source monitoring tools such as SNORT and SPLUNK Agents

  System security architectures and concepts                                Gen Sys Sec: SY204 supports these concepts such as Hiding from ls, Untouchables.

  Defense in depth                                                          These are demonstrated in labs and lectures in SY401/402 - there . This is analogous to US Navy defense in depth leveraged in Naval Operations by Carrier Battlegroups. There is no single cybersecurity tool that can protect a network - and all elements of the problems are discussed - from human faults, HW/SW faults to physical vulnerabilities.

  Trust relationships                                                       Exploiting trust is demonstrated inn SY401 using the Social Engineering Toolkit in Metasploit. Use of the Veil framework demonstrates in labs how to defeat AV products in offensive operations.

  Distributed/Cloud                                                         This is covered in SY401/402 with a special lecture from NSA CAPS representative on large software development.

  Virtualization                                                            These are demonstrated in labs and lectures in SY401/402. Virtual Machines are created and used in a variety of lab applications as well as a hypervisor in the USNA cyber.moboard environment.

Outcome: Students will have a sound understanding of the technologies
and methods utilized to defend systems and networks. They will be able
to describe, evaluate, and operate a defensive network architecture
employing multiple layers of protection using technologies appropriate
to meet mission security goals.

In addition to course syllabi, applications must include examples of
hands-on lab exercises to demonstrate that students have achieved
mastery of this KU.
