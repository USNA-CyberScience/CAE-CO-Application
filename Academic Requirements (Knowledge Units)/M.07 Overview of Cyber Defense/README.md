# M.7 Overview of Cyber Defense (must include hands-on lab exercises)

Cyber operations encompass both offensive and defensive operations.
Defensive operations are essential in protecting our systems and
associated digital assets. Understanding how defense compliments offense
is essential in a well-rounded cyber operations program.

Specific topics to be covered in this knowledge unit include, but are
not limited to:

<table>

			<th>Topic</th>
			<th>Assessment</th>

		<tr>
			<td width="50%">Identification of reconnaissance operations</td>
			<td width="50%">These techniques are demonstrated in labs and lectures in SY401 as both passive and active reconnaissance using open source tools such as NMAP.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="50%">Anomaly/intrusion detection</td>
			<td width="50%">These techniques are demonstrated in labs and lectures in SY402 using student built rules in python and using SNORT.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="50%">Anomaly identification</td>
			<td width="50%">These are demonstrated in SY402 labs using SPLUNK and SNORT using rules and behavior based labs.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="50%">Identification of command and control operations</td>
			<td width="50%">These are discussed and demonstrated in SY401 (offensive operations) and SY402 (defensive operations). The development of C&C infrastructure using VMs is also discussed and demonstrated in labs/lectures using Metasploit, Armitage, and ToR.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="50%">Identification of data exfiltration activities</td>
			<td width="50%">These are demonstrated in labs and lectures in SY401/402. We discuss COVCOM and use of ToR for hiding traffic as well as use of exploits that take advantage of routine services and ports to exfil traffic from a host or network. See SY401 course material</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="50%">Identifying malicious code based on signatures, behavior and artifacts</td>
			<td width="50%">These are demonstrated in labs and lectures in SY401/402. We discuss the use of VirusTotal for identifying hashes and SHAs as well as how AV leverages cloud based and behavioral characteristics</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="50%">Network security techniques and components (e.g., firewalls, IDS, etc.)</td>
			<td width="50%">
				<p>These are demonstrated in labs and lectures in SY401/402 using open source tools such as SNORT and packet sniffers
				<p>Firewalls: SY205, planned CY2020 Fall.

		<tr>
			<td width="50%">Cryptography (include PKI cryptography) and its uses in cybersecurity</td>
			<td width="50%">SY308 discusses this area and this is re-enforces in SY401and 402.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="50%">Malicious activity detection</td>
			<td width="50%">These are discussed and demonstrated in labs and lectures in SY401/402 using open source monitoring tools such as SNORT and SPLUNK Agents</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="50%">System security architectures and concepts</td>
			<td width="50%">Gen Sys Sec: SY204 supports these concepts such as Hiding from ls, Untouchables.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="50%">Defense in depth</td>
			<td width="50%">These are demonstrated in labs and lectures in SY401/402 - there . This is analogous to US Navy defense in depth leveraged in Naval Operations by Carrier Battlegroups. There is no single cybersecurity tool that can protect a network - and all elements of the problems are discussed - from human faults, HW/SW faults to physical vulnerabilities.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="50%">Trust relationships</td>
			<td width="50%">Exploiting trust is demonstrated inn SY401 using the Social Engineering Toolkit in Metasploit. Use of the Veil framework demonstrates in labs how to defeat AV products in offensive operations.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="50%">Distributed/Cloud</td>
			<td width="50%">This is covered in SY401/402 with a special lecture from NSA CAPS representative on large software development.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="50%">Virtualization</td>
			<td width="50%">These are demonstrated in labs and lectures in SY401/402. Virtual Machines are created and used in a variety of lab applications as well as a hypervisor in the USNA cyber.moboard environment.</td>

Outcome: Students will have a sound understanding of the technologies
and methods utilized to defend systems and networks. They will be able
to describe, evaluate, and operate a defensive network architecture
employing multiple layers of protection using technologies appropriate
to meet mission security goals.

In addition to course syllabi, applications must include examples of
hands-on lab exercises to demonstrate that students have achieved
mastery of this KU.
