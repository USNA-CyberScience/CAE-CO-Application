M.3 Operating System Theory

Operating systems (OS) provide the platform on which running software
acquires and uses computing resources. Operating systems are responsible
for working with the underlying hardware to provide the baseline
security capabilities of a system. Understanding the underlying theory
of operating system design is critical to cyber operations as operating
systems control the operation of a computer and the allocation of
associated resources.

Outcome: Students will have a thorough understanding of operating
systems theory and implementation. They will be able to understand
operating system internals to the level that they could design and
implement simple architectural changes to an existing OS.
