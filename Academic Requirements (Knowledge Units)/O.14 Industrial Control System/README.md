# O.14 Industrial Control System (ICS)

ICSs are crucial to the operations of U.S. critical infrastructures that
are often widely deployed, interconnected and mutually dependent
systems. ICSs can include Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition
(SCADA) systems and Distributed Control Systems (DCS), and other control
system configurations. Several infrastructures that use ICSs have
critical national security impact including electric, water and
wastewater, oil and natural gas, transportation, chemical, and
aerospace. Cyber operators should have knowledge of the attack and
defense of ICSs.

Specific topics to be covered in this knowledge unit include, but are
not limited to:

*Outcome*: Students will have an overall comprehension of key U.S.
infrastructures controlled by ICS including the associated
vulnerabilities associated with each infrastructure.

*Outcome*: Students will be able to describe how embedded systems are
employed in industrial infrastructures and control systems. They will be
able to identify means for capturing instrument telemetry and
identifying feedback controls. They should be able to describe methods
for managing distributed nodes and identify potential security
vulnerabilities associated with the use of such systems and means for
mitigating these vulnerabilities.

*Outcome*: Students will be able to demonstrate the ability to discover
and understand an ICS environment and identify the attack surface.
