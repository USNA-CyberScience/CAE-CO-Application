# M.8 Security Fundamental Principles (i.e., "First Principles")

The first fundamental security design principles are the foundation upon
which security mechanisms (e.g., access control) can be reliably built.
They are also the foundation upon which security policies can be
reliably implemented. When followed, the first principles enable the
implementation of sound security mechanisms and systems. When not
completely followed, the risk that an exploitable vulnerability may
exist is increased. A solid understanding of these principles is
critical to successful performance in the cyber operations domain.

Specific topics to be covered in this knowledge unit include, but are
not limited to:

*Outcome*: Students will possess a thorough understanding of the
fundamental principles underlying cyber security, how these principles
interrelate and are typically employed to achieve assured solutions, the
mechanisms that may be built from or due to these principles.

*Outcome*: Given a particular scenario, students will be able to
identify which fundamental security design principles are in play, how
they interrelate and methods in which they should be applied to develop
systems worthy of trust.

*Outcome*: Students will understand how failures in fundamental security
design principles can lead to system vulnerabilities that can be
exploited as part of an offensive cyber operation.
