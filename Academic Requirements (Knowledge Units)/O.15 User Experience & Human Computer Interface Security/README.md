# O.15 User Experience (UX)/Human Computer Interface (HCI) Security

HCI is the practice and study of human interaction with machines. This
includes usability, machine interaction design, and psychological
reactions to the interface. UX deals with the entirety of the user
experience relative to a product (not just the user interface). UX
includes HCI but also encompasses the emotional, physical, and
behavioral perception of a product or service. Cyber security
professionals must acknowledge that while they need to give utmost
precedence to system security, they cannot overlook user experience, and
vice versa.

Specific topics to be covered in this knowledge unit include, but are
not limited to:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr><th>Topic</th><th>Assessment</th></tr>
<tr><td width="50%">Authentication interfaces and passwords</td><td>Authentication interfaces are discussed in SY304 as primary topics in four lessons, while they are touched upon in six additional lessons as a secondary focus. One lesson has passwords and the psychology of password management as its central topic, while passwords in general are used as examples and secondary topics in four additional lessons. Students are asked to design an authentication GUI that humans can actually understand and consider the impact that user interfaces have on the security of networks.</td></tr>
<tr><td width="50%">Implicit and explicit policies in systems</td><td>Implicit and explicit policies are discussed throughout the SY304 course, specifically in the password periodicity discussion during the psychology of password management lesson. Implicit and explicit policies with regard to physical access is discussed as a primary topic in three lessons: tailgating and piggybacking, shoulder surfing, dumpster diving. During the lockpicking lab students are also asked to consider access control policies and the risks associated with ease of access.</td></tr>
<tr><td width="50%">Policies that users control and hidden policies controlled by the system</td><td>Controlled and hidden policies are discussed throughout SY304 but are not the sole subject of any particular lesson. Nevertheless, in six lessons controlled policies are discussed explicitly while policies that are hidden are discussed in three of these lessons. The “Tiger Team” pen-testing case study lesson includes a deep discussion of both user-controlled policies and hidden policies both in terms of the vulnerabilities found by the pen-testing team and in the improvements required to mitigate these vulnerabilities. Both controlled and hidden policies are also discussed as primary topics in the lesson on secure data deletion.</td></tr>
<tr><td width="50%">The role of social engineering and how it continues to be the primary attack vector</td><td>SY304 has this topic as its main focus and theme, with eight full lessons and three hands-on labs specifically dedicated to this topic. For the remaining lessons, this theme forms the background of the discussions. Specifically dedicated lessons include psychological explanations of social engineering and pretexting, the history and theory of social engineering, automated social engineering (ASE), reverse social engineering, all types of phishing (e.g. vishing, pharming, spearphishing, etc.), impersonation attacks and other in-person social attacks, tailgating and piggybacking, shoulder surfing, dumpster diving, and a number of other topics. The labs include a lockpicking lab, a phishing e-mail lab (using Kali Linux), a browser exploitation lab (using BeEF), and a credential harvesting lab (using Kali Linux).</td></tr>
<tr><td width="50%">How implementing security affects the user experience.</td><td>SY304 includes five lessons that have as one of their primary topics how the implementation of security measures affects the user experience. For example, during the psychology of password management lesson, students are asked to consider a shoulder-surfing resistant password scheme that is so complex that the user experience would be completely ruined. During the firewall lesson, students learn how draconian firewall restrictions so restrict data availability that humans will often simply turn off the firewall, thereby rendering their system less secure.</td></tr>

*Outcome*: Students will understand user interface issues that will
affect the implementation of and perception of security mechanisms and
the behavioral impacts of various security "policies."

*Outcome*: Students will understand the tension between user security
and convenience which results in user behavior that undermines system
security. Students will learn how to develop approaches which have the
right balance.
