# M.5 Cellular and Mobile Technologies

As more communications are conducted via mobile and cellular
technologies, these technologies have become critical (and continue to
become more critical) to cyber operations. It is important for those
involved in cyber operations to understand how data is processed and
transmitted using these ubiquitous devices.

Specific topics to be covered in this knowledge unit include, but are
not limited to:

*Outcome*: Students will be able to describe user associations and
routing in a cellular/mobile network, interaction of elements within the
cellular/mobile core, and end-to-end delivery of a packet and/or signal
and what happens with the hand-off at each step along the communications
path. They will be able to explain differences in core architecture
between different generations of cellular and mobile network
technologies.
