#### M.5 Cellular and Mobile Technologies

As more communications are conducted via mobile and cellular
technologies, these technologies have become critical (and continue to
become more critical) to cyber operations. It is important for those
involved in cyber operations to understand how data is processed and
transmitted using these ubiquitous devices.

Specific topics to be covered in this knowledge unit include, but are
not limited to:

  Overview of smart phone technologies                                                   []{#_heading=h.gjdgxs .anchor}Covered in one class period. This entire course (SY312/SY488A) was designed based on feedback from the NSA-CAE application in 2018.
  Overview of embedded operating systems (e.g., iOS, Android)                            While not explicitly covered in SY312/SY488A, students will meet the outcome noted below. SY401 does discuss exploitation of these OSs are part of the Kali Linux toolkit.
  Wireless technologies (mobile: GSM, WCDMA, CDMA2000, LTE; and Internet: 802.11b/g/n)   GSM 4 class periods, LTE 3 class periods, WiFi 2 class periods.
  Infrastructure components (e.g., fiber optic network, evolved packet core, PLMN)       Topics covered: fiber optics, Ethernet, coaxial transmissions to include signal loss over a distance, bandwidth and applicable tables and equations (2 classes). Evolved packet core and PLMN covered by white papers and in class discussions (2 classes).
  Mobile protocols (SS7, RR, MM, CC)                                                     Covered by whitepapers and in class discussions (1 class period). TDMA, CDMA, FDMA covered in 1 class period. Signal encoding covered 2 class periods.
  Mobile logical channel descriptions (BCCH, SDCCH, RACH, AGCH, etc.)                    Covered by whitepapers and in class discussions (1 class).
  Mobile registration procedures                                                         Covered by whitepapers and in class discussions (1 class).
  Mobile encryptions standards                                                           In SY308 - discussion of A5/1 in GSM and how it was broken in the early 2000s, leading to the many security and privacy issues with cellular phones along with discussion of the replacement cipher used in 4G and 5G called SNOW.
  Mobile identifiers (IMSI, IMEI, MSISDN, ESN, Global Title, E.164)                      Covered by whitepapers and in class discussions (1 class).
  Mobile and Location-based Services                                                     Covered by whitepapers and in class discussions (1 class).

*Outcome*: Students will be able to describe user associations and
routing in a cellular/mobile network, interaction of elements within the
cellular/mobile core, and end-to-end delivery of a packet and/or signal
and what happens with the hand-off at each step along the communications
path. They will be able to explain differences in core architecture
between different generations of cellular and mobile network
technologies.
