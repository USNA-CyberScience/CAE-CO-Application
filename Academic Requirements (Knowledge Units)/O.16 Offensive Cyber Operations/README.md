# O.16 Offensive Cyber Operations

Offensive cyber operations is everything related to reconnaissance and
exploitation in the cyber space offensive mission. This knowledge unit
provides a high-level overview of the different phases of cyber
operations including target identification, reconnaissance,
fingerprinting, development of operational plans, decision
authorities/authorization, execution, and assessment.

Specific topics to be covered in this knowledge unit include, but are
not limited to:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr><th>Topic</th><th>Assessment</th></tr>
<tr><td width="50%">Cyber attacks are restricted to military members of DoD, as restricted by international law. Authorities are derived from U.S. Code Title 10.</td><td width="50%">SY403 discusses the specific authorities granted to the DoD and spends two lessons distinguishing them from the authorities of intelligence agencies, federal agencies (especially DHS and DOJ/FBI) and the private sector. Four SY403 in-class exercises are devoted to exploring DoD authorities in various scenarios (two of these exercises require students to assume roles as the principals representing DHS, DOJ, DoD, and the IC in strategy deliberations at the National Security Council; other exercises are centered on tactical and strategic military levels). SY403 covers US national cyber strategy, DoD cyber strategy, relevant US law (e.g., NDAA19 which modified DoD cyber authorities), and JP3-12 (DoD guidance on cyber operations tactics and integration into traditional military campaigns) in detail.</td></tr>
<tr><td width="50%">Cyber kill chain</td><td width="50%">The Mitre attack framework is covered by SY403 in detail in a lesson devoted to Cyber operational tactics. SY403 guest speakers from NSA provide additional context to the operational context of both offensive and defensive cyber operations (Fall 2019 hosted two currently serving NSA subject matter experts). Defensive tactics are also covered in SY403, largely through the lens of the NIST framework.</td></tr>
<tr><td width="50%">Mission planning and execution process</td><td width="50%">SY401 discusses the phases as an outline for the semester schedule - labs and lecture re-enforce these steps (see [*here)*](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LkseQ2tklYhynItAtBmozT_ct9yd0V4d/edit#slide=id.p1)</td></tr>
<tr><td width="50%">Define mission objectives and desired effects from the overall mission standpoint</td><td width="50%">SY401 demonstrates this for host based attacks using open source tools in weekly labs. SY403 devotes one lesson each to US military cyber tactics (centered on DoD JP3-12) and US military cyber strategy (centered on USCYBERCOM doctrine, DoD cyber strategy, and enabling law and US national security strategy)</td></tr>
<tr><td width="50%">The different phases of cyber operations</td><td width="50%">SY401 discusses the phases as an outline for the semester schedule - labs and lecture re-enforce these steps (see [*here)*](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LkseQ2tklYhynItAtBmozT_ct9yd0V4d/edit#slide=id.p1) SY403 covers cyber operations campaigns in both classroom lectures (separate lessons on tactical employment and overall strategy) and through exercises. The final course exercise is built around competition and conflict between the US and the PRC over events originating in contested waters of the South China Sea. in preparation for the SY403 final exercise, students must research and provide written recommendations bearing on US strategy and tactics for a state-to-state cyber engagement involving US military forces.</td></tr>

*Outcome*: Students will understand the phases of a cyber operation,
what each phase entails, who has authorities to conduct each phase, and
how operations are assessed after completion.
