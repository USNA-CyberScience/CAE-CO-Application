## Project Mbed

You and a partner will analyze and modify the operation of an embedded
device for which you only have access to machine level code (Given in
the **AsmLab.s** starter file attached).  

You need to set up a project to *modify and debug this code*. Then your
task is to complete the following challenges:

1.  Make the code repeatedly blink LED1 On and Off. (Can be shown
    stepping through debugger)

    -   Starter code is flawed. Must be immediately debugged then
        improved.

2.  Add noticeable time delays between turning the light On and Off
    (slower blink).

3.  Extend this code to blink all 4 LEDs ( Extra Credit available for
    the most impressive patterns)

Document and comment in your **AsmLab.s** file and submit the final
version here with the information of all group members and details of
what you accomplished in your submission comments.

**What to submit:**

1. Rename your AsmLab.s file to AsmLab.s.txt so it can be processed
properly by Blackboard.  Submit that file.

2. Leave detailed comments about what your group was able to accomplish
in the lab.
