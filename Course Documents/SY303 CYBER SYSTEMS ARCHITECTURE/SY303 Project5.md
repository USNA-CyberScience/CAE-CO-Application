## Project 5

Implement the following computer gates as specified in Chapter 5 of your
book:

**Memory, CPU, Computer**

-   Code these parts in Hardware Description Language

-   Test their operation by running the test binary files

    -   Add.hack – Program performs signed addition

    -   Max.hack – Program tests comparison and determines largest
        integer

    -   Rect.hack – Program tests I/O by drawing rectangle on the
        virtual screen

    -   **cp Gate.hdl Gate.hdl.txt**

    -   Be sure to replace "Gate" with the name of the actual logic gate
        you are submitting

    -   Please use BUILT-IN chips as specified in the book's project
        description!!!!!

Files to submit (for each gate):

1.  The appropriately named Gate.hdl.txt file as created above
    (Do NOT submit the original .hdl files).

2.  **A scanned graphical DRAWING of the gate logic you are implementing
    in code.**
