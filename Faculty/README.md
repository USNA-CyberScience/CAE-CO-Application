# Faculty Involvement in Cyber Operations-related Research

Faculty members have research interests in a wide range of areas related
to cyber operations, including cryptography, privacy, human factors,
social engineering, security, authentication, digital forensics,
cybercrime, incident response, trust and deception, embedded systems,
firmware, reverse engineering, cyberspace policy, law, ethics, and
strategy. These projects require the collection and analysis of data
from networks, physical devices, and the web (social media extracts). A
full list of keywords related to research topics of interest and under
investigation appears in the supporting documentation.

Since 2014, the faculty have collectively published 77 book chapters,
articles in peer reviewed journals and conference proceedings, and other
peer-reviewed materials. Professor Kosseff has published two books. An
additional 10 works are in preparation or submitted for publication.
Faculty members also report 31 presentations since 2017 on a broad range
of topics. These presentations include keynote addresses and other
conference presentations, congressional testimony, community engagement
and other educational outreach. In the past three years (Fall
2017-Spring 2020), 54 midshipmen have participated in independent
research for course credit, and these collaborations have resulted in 6
faculty articles co-authored with midshipmen, to-date (with more
expected as the work-in-progress matures).

Faculty have attracted extramural grant funding totaling over \$2.5
million from a variety of sources, including the National Science
Foundation, the Carnegie Foundation, the Minerva Institute, the
Department of the Army and the Office of Naval Research. Details appear
in the supporting documentation.
